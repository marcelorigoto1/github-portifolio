  <h1>International Spring School on Visualization (ISSonVIS 2025)</h1>
  <h2>Theme: <em>Seeing Through Lies: Mapping Trust in the Age of Misinformation</em></h2>
  <p>
    Participating in the <strong>International Spring School on Visualization (ISSonVIS 2025)</strong>, hosted by Palacký University in Olomouc, was an inspiring and thought-provoking experience. This year’s theme — <em>“Seeing Through Lies: Mapping Trust in the Age of Misinformation”</em> — resonated deeply in our increasingly digital and data-driven world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over two dynamic days, we engaged in interdisciplinary conversations on the power and responsibility of <strong>visual storytelling</strong>. The program explored how maps and data visualizations can shape perception, build or erode trust, and influence public understanding in both subtle and overt ways.
  </p>
  <div class="highlight">
    <p>
      A central theme was that <strong>maps are not neutral artifacts</strong>. We examined how every map involves choices — what is shown, what is hidden, and how narratives are constructed through spatial representation. As future professionals in <strong>urban planning</strong> and <strong>geoinformatics</strong>, this raised important ethical questions about how our work affects communities.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The sessions delved into the historical and political dimensions of cartography, reminding us that spatial data has often been used to reinforce power structures. At the same time, we explored how maps can empower and engage the public when designed transparently and inclusively.
  </p>
  <h3>Highlights and Key Insights:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Visualization and misinformation:</strong> understanding how false narratives spread visually</li>
    <li><strong>Eye-tracking and perception studies:</strong> exploring how viewers interpret visual cues</li>
    <li><strong>Participatory mapping:</strong> tools to foster community input and shared decision-making</li>
    <li><strong>Ethics in cartography:</strong> managing uncertainty and bias in visual communication</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Through hands-on tasks, case studies, and group discussions, we developed critical skills for evaluating and creating visual content with ethical integrity. The course emphasized that effective visualization is not just about aesthetics or clarity — it's about building <strong>trust</strong>, ensuring <strong>inclusion</strong>, and being mindful of the power visual media holds.
  </p>
  <h3>Skills and Takeaways</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Critical analysis of visual media and geospatial content</li>
    <li>Ethical design principles in visualization and mapping</li>
    <li>Understanding perceptual biases in user interpretation</li>
    <li>Strategies for combating misinformation through visual clarity</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    This experience has reshaped how I think about maps — not as static representations of reality, but as living, persuasive narratives. Whether in academic research, urban design, or humanitarian work, the lessons from ISSonVIS will guide me in creating visualizations that are not only informative but also <strong>empathetic</strong>, <strong>inclusive</strong>, and <strong>truthful</strong>.
