  <h1>Blended Intensive Programme (BIP) – University of Bucharest</h1>

    The Blended Intensive Programme hosted by the University of Bucharest focusing on <strong>Quantifying vulnerability to natural hazards in changing climate patterns. New perspectives and methods</strong>
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Virtual Classes</h2>
    <p>Over 5 weeks, weekly sessions were held covering the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vulnerability in the Age of the Anthropocene</li>
      <li>State of the climate</li>
      <li>Sea level changes - changes to coastal areas and adaptation methods</li>
      <li>Social Vulnerability in Coastal Environments</li>
      <li>Climatic and tectonic signals in landscape evolution of active orogens</li>
      <li>Changing geohazards in response to tectonic and climatic forcing</li>
      <li>Dynamics of geohazards and disasters in fragile coupled landscapes under changing climate</li>
      <li>How to increase the resilience of landscapes and communities to climate change impacts</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p>This was very important for me because we could gain a lot of previous knowledge to use and observe in the field activities.</p>

    <h2>Field activities in the Vrancea Seismic Region</h2>
    <p>
      In the first day, we met in Bucharest and went to the Geography Campus of the Bucharest University for introductory lectures
       on relevant geomorphology concepts and background to the area.
        We then walked around the city observing retrofitting measures on buildings and
         assessed structures at high risk of failure in the event of another major earthquake like the one in 1977 that struck on March 4, 
         measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale and causing widespread destruction, especially in Bucharest.
          Over 1,500 people were killed and thousands of buildings were damaged or destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the visit to the university, we continued to Pătârlagele in the Vrancea seismic region.
       The following days included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visits to shallow landslides in the molasse sector of the Subcarpathians</li>
      <li>Assessment of slope instability near a large reservoir</li>
      <li>Observation of an earthquake-induced landslide and mudflows</li>
      <li>Exploration of vulnerability differences in village buildings</li>
      <li>Visit to mud volcanoes and discussion on DRR in protected areas</li>
      <li>Group presentations on impact chains at the Pătârlagele Natural Hazards Research Center</li>
    </ul>
